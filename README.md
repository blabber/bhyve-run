bhyve-run.sh
============

This is a simple script to install, run and destroy [bhyve](http://bhyve.org)
VMs loaded by [grub2-bhyve](https://github.com/grehan-freebsd/grub2-bhyve). So
this is mainly for non-FreeBSD guests. For FreeBSD guest the official vmrun.sh
(located in /usr/share/examples/bhyve/vmrun.sh) works just fine.
